I know that there is still a lot of what seems like extra time
but after talking to the sound people at the venue I think there
is a case to be made for having extra time baked into the schedule.

Questions:
Will there be any setup requirements for your set? (drum kit setup, lights, mics, etc)

Potential challenges:
There is a dance club under the venue that will be playing loud music. You'll
be able to hear it through the floor.

Artists in the show:
If you have any questions of the other artists, for vibe checks and possible colaboration
their contact information is listed below.
