  "Autumn is at once a symbol of plenty, ripening, harvest, and abundance
  ; and; at the same time, A symbol of decay and decline, old age, and even
  death, with associations of things being passed their prime"
                              -Dr. Oliver Tearle: Loughborough University


Thanks for showing interest in the Autumn Soulstice!
While I would have liked for us to be able to perform on the literal
first day of fall, It seems that the Strut is that day so that is out.
I was, however, able to Confirm for 30 Sept (The last Saturday of the month)


Detailed Breakdown:
Date: 30 Sept
Time: 20:00 - 23:00 (8-11)
Set length: 30min
Payout: 10% of bar sales
Location: Buteco EAV

Color themes: While I understand that the majority of autumn celebrations use the colors of a dying tree (and those are still okay to use)
I would also like to feature the colors of the twilight sky. Mainly to take
a less literal thematic throughline focusing on the "Sun setting on summer" and other transitional thematic elements.

Inspirational media
"The trees" -Philip Larken
"in summer twilight" - Joshua Henry Jones Jr

I would like to meet with the artists that would like to confirm their spot
(Virtually or in person) So that we can answer questions, work out the Order of performances, and
share information to use on flyers. I will be in New York from
Wed 6 Sept - Mon 11 Sept. The following week (11-15) will be the best time to reach
out. But if you need, reach me outside of that, text me and let me know.

Thanks again for Showing interest in what I know will be a great show!
